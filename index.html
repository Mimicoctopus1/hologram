      /*For this program to work, you will need a hologram projector. It doesn't project real holograms, but it looks like it does, hence the name. You can learn how to make one with household items online (shorturl.at/aszQS), but if you don't have one, don't blame me if this program is useless to you. 

This is optional but it will help make your holograph run better: fill in the variables below. Note that all of your images must have the same proportion between height and width. If you are animating a custom hologram, make sure to use the Frames Per Second (FPS) meter to change how fast your animation will be. If you put it too fast for your comuputer, it will run at its max speed, which can crash your computer (but it isn't as bad as it might sound). Also, change guidelines to true to show lines to put your hologram projector in the right spot*/
